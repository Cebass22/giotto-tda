    "\n",
    "In `giotto-tda`, a non-fully connected weighted graph can be represented by an adjacency matrix in one of two possible forms:\n",
    "- a dense square array with `np.inf` in position ij if the edge between vertex i and vertex j is absent.\n",
    "- a sparse matrix in which the non-stored edge weights represent absent edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important notes**\n",
    "- A `0` in a dense array, or an explicitly stored `0` in a sparse matrix, does *not* denote an absent edge. It denotes an edge with weight 0, which, in a sense, means the complete opposite! See the section ***Understanding the computation*** below.\n",
    "- Dense Boolean arrays are first converted to numerical ones and then interpreted as adjacency matrices of FCW graphs. `False` values therefore should not be used to represent absent edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the computation \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what these persistence diagrams are telling us about the input weighted graphs, we briefly explain the **clique complex (or flag complex) filtration** procedure underlying the computations in `VietorisRipsPersistence` when `metric=\"precomputed\"`, via an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start with a special case of a weighted graph with adjacency matrix as follows:\n",
    "- the diagonal entries (\"vertex weights\") are all zero;\n",
    "- all off-diagonal entries (edge weights) are non-negative;\n",
    "- some edge weights are infinite (or very very large).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can lay such a graph on the plane to visualise it, drawing only the finite edges:\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ulupo/giotto-tda/examples/flagser_notebook/examples/images/weighted_graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure can be explained as follows: we let a parameter $\\varepsilon$ start at 0, and as we increase it all the way to infinity we keep considering the instantaneous subgraphs made of a) all the vertices in the original graph, and b) those edges whose weight is less than or equal to the current $\\varepsilon$. We also promote these subgraphs to more general structures called **(simplicial) complexes** that, alongside vertices and edges, also possess $k$**-simplices**, i.e. selected subsets of $k + 1$ vertices (a 2-simplex is an abstract \"triangle\", a 3-simplex an abstract \"tetrahedron\", etc). Our criterion is this: for each integer $k \\geq 2$, all $(k + 1)$-cliques in each instantaneous subgraph are declared to be the $k$-simplices of the subgraph's associated complex. By definition, the $0$-simplices are the vertices and the $1$-simplices are the available edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "As $\\varepsilon$ increases from 0 (included) to infinity, we record the following information:\n",
    "1. How many new **connected components** are created because of the appearance of vertices (in this example, all vertices \"appear\" in one go at $\\varepsilon = 0$, by definition!), or merge because of the appearance of new edges.\n",
    "2. How many new 1-dimensional \"holes\", 2-dimensional \"cavities\", or more generally $d$-dimensional **voids** are created in the instantaneous complex. A hole, cavity, or $d$-dimensional void is such only if there is no collection of \"triangles\", \"tetrahedra\", or $(d + 1)$-simplices which the void is the \"boundary\" of. *Note*: Although the edges of a triangle *alone* \"surround a hole\", these cannot occur in our particular construction because the \"filling\" triangle is also declared present in the complex when all its edges are.\n",
    "3. How many $d$-dimensional voids which were present at earlier values of $\\epsilon$ are \"filled\" by $(d + 1)$-simplices which just appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of recording the full topological history of the graph across all edge weights is called (Vietoris-Rips) **persistent homology**!\n",

    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ulupo/giotto-tda/examples/flagser_notebook/examples/images/clique_complex_0_small.png)\n",
    "There are 9 connected components, and nothing much else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to and including $\\varepsilon = 2$, a few more edges are added which make some of the connected components merge together but do not create any hole, triangles, or higher cliques. Let us look at $\\varepsilon = 3$:\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ulupo/giotto-tda/examples/flagser_notebook/examples/images/clique_complex_3_small.png)\n",
    "The newly arrived edges reduce the number of connected components further, but more interestingly they create a 1D hole!\n",
